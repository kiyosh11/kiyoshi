<p>tbh idk what i'm doing, chat. this will either be a great post or the worst post ever. anyway, if you've seen my posts on X, i've talked a lot about having fun, and you might ask why do i keep saying that. well, it's actually a pretty funny reason...</p>

<p>a long time ago, i used to hate everything. every single thing looked boring. i didn't want to do shit anymore, even coding. i'd just sit on the couch and look at instagram all day. the only thing i hated more than anything was school. i hated that place with all my heart, but i had to put a smile on my face and act like i was having fun every single day. the same thing, my hate for it kept getting bigger. it wasn't that i hated the people there, i just hated school itself.</p>

<p>but funny thing is, one day i saw a quote. if i'm not mistaken, it was from an anime or a movie. i don't really remember lol, but it was about life. at that moment, i realized smth. i realized that i was chasing excitement, love, and fun itself, but i was playing by their rules, not my rules. since that day, i gave up on chasing excitement, love, and fun. i stopped playing by their rules and started exploring new things like writing music and singing (i can sing a little lol, it's really bad).</p>

<p>i started looking at the world in another way, focusing on the fun things, not the boring ones. i realized that i went from chasing fun, love, and excitement to it coming to me naturally. long story short, just look at things from a different perspective. look at the fun and exciting side of things, and that's when you'll find true fun. i would love to hear your thoughts about this post, don't hesitate to dm me!<br><br>kiyoshi out</p>
