<h2 class="post-title">why should you POST</h2>
<div class="post-content">
<p>lets just be honest most of you all just want to make money of X and dont really care about POSTING whats on ur mind and sharing stuff you wouldn't share irl. is this not a good thing and why you wont enjoy POSTING on X?</p>

<p>imo POSTING for money is not a bad thing everyone wants to make money and say to their friends and family ive made money online its most of the young people's goal to make money online, but trying to make money of X isnt always an easy thing cuz you'll have to think of perfect POSTS that will blow up and get u the 500 required verified followers and the 5mil impressions but at the same time you'll mostly wont enjoy thinking about all that and will just say its too much work and give up. but hear me out tho, what if you just POST whats on ur mind like ur thoughts, your feelings why dont you POST those like i did and alot of people are doing the same thing and getting money of X and sharing their thoughts and feelings with people it's a win win dont you think?</p>

<p>this question might have popped on your mind "why should I share my thoughts and feelings on a social media app?" well let me tell you a story of someone, there once was a person that never talked with people they just never shared their feelings and thoughts with other people and you might ask why? well thats simple not everyone irl wants to hear about ur thoughts and feelings, they dont care about what u are feeling or what ur thoughts are on smth so long story short they never shared anything and cuz of that they started overthinking about everything, hating the fact that no one cared and hated the people that didnt care.</p>

<p>you might say "not everyone is like you say, some people will listen to you and stuff". well this is true too but not even the ones that will listen will actually care. we got of track didnt we ahaha so what i wanted to say was that person found out about X.com the everything app from a friend, he actually POSTED stuff and had a pretty decent followers amount so that person started POSTING on X since that day his thoughts and feelings and guess what some people actually felt the same as that person, some were like that person so that person got new friends, is sharing whats on their mind without overthinking and feeling like shit all the time cuz if you dont share what ur thinking and ur feelings you will start destroying urself like that person did.</p>

<p>you might say "X isnt a perfect place where i can say whatever i want" well its social media lol but X doesn't censor most of the shit spoken there and sure you might get haters too, people love hating its in their nature but 100 will hate and 1000 will love remember that. so just POST :)</p>
